# Netlify Extension

This extension is created using the [Netlify SDK](https://sdk.netlify.com/get-started/introduction/). It is a boilerplate for creating a new extension.

## Scripts

These are some common scripts you will use when developing your extension. If you want to know what else is possible, [check out the documentation](https://developers.netlify.com/sdk/netlify-sdk-utility-tools-reference/).

### Build

This builds the extension into a `.ntli` folder. This is the folder that Netlify uses to run the extension.

```bash
npm run build
```


## Publish

Are you ready to deploy and publish your extension? Check out our documentation on [publishing your extension](https://developers.netlify.com/sdk/publish/).
